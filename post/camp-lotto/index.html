<p>There&rsquo;s a great <a href="https://www.ymcamn.org/camps/camp_du_nord">family camp</a> my family has attended over the years.
We spend a week on a beautiful lake with good friends, pawn our children off for a few hours each day, and disconnect from the world.</p>

<p>It started as a tiny little family camp decades ago, and is now so popular there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.ymcamn.org/camps/camp_du_nord/family_camp/summer/summer_reservations__lottery">lottery system</a> held each winter to determine who gets in for the summer.</p>

<p>The lottery process has some major flaws though, and gives a sour taste to an otherwise well-executed operation.  Specifically:</p>

<h4 id="it-wastes-time">It Wastes Time</h4>

<p>Applicants register for the lottery online with their preferences, choosing preferred cabins, weeks, and a preference of cabin vs. week (i.e. is the week more important than the cabin?).
This is good.</p>

<p>But the actual lottery happens on a Saturday and requires all applicants to be available from 8am-1pm.
The staff calls each family in order, discusses the options again, and the family makes a choice based on what&rsquo;s available.</p>

<p>As an applicant, blocking out half a Saturday to be available by phone for a frantic mini-planning session is a hassle, and if you miss the call you get bumped down the list.
And I can only imagine how chaotic the office must be.
There are 12 weeks available each summer, with around 45 sites.
That&rsquo;s over 500 potential reservations to make over the phone, followed by an apology call to each family that was waiting all morning and didn&rsquo;t make the lottery.</p>

<h4 id="it-s-unfair">It&rsquo;s Unfair</h4>

<p>So you didn&rsquo;t make the lottery this year.  Oh well.  Looks like we&rsquo;ll have to vacation on our private island <em>again</em>.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if you were put in the front of the line for next year&rsquo;s lottery?
There&rsquo;s nothing in place currently to allow this though, and some people wait years to get in.</p>

<h4 id="it-doesn-t-produce-the-best-outcome">It Doesn&rsquo;t Produce The Best Outcome</h4>

<p>Applicants each make a different set of choices, and those available choices narrow as the lottery progresses.
In the end, the organization is left with a number of unpicked sites and weeks.<br />
What if the first family chosen in the lottery would&rsquo;ve been happy with one of those unpicked sites?
With a manual lottery process, you only get one pass.
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if you could optimize the combination of preferred sites and weeks to produce a lottery that accomodated the most campers?</p>

<h1 id="camp-lotto">Camp Lotto</h1>

<p>Thus was born <a href="https://github.com/dtanner/camplotto">Camp Lotto</a> - an attempt to solve these problems.
At a high level, it takes a list of available reservations and lottery registrations, and produces a list of reservations.
The process is similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo simulation</a>,
in that it simulates the lottery many times.  The winner is the lottery simulation that leaves the fewest number of available reservations.</p>

<h4 id="features">Features</h4>

<ul>
<li>Applicants give 3 pieces of info: an ordered list of acceptable sites, an ordered list of acceptable weeks, and a preference indicating if their week or site should be prioritized when finding the next available reservation.</li>
<li>You can mark applicants as having priority (e.g. those people that didn&rsquo;t get in last year). Every time it runs the lottery simulation, it places them at the top of the shuffled list.</li>
<li>You can mark sites as unavailable for certain weeks.  e.g. Scheduled repairs or other known unavailabilies.</li>
<li>Along with producing a spreadsheet of reservations, it also produces a sheet of any sites still open and unmatched registrations.
Those remaining sites could be made available for open enrollment, and next year all the unmatched registrations could be given priority.
<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="input-and-output-examples">Input and Output Examples</h4>

<p>The first iteration of the app uses a spreadsheet for input and output, because everyone knows how to use a spreadsheet. Here&rsquo;s what the available reservations sheet looks like:<br />
<img src="/camplotto/input-available-reservations.png" alt="" /><br />
An <code>x</code> in the cell indicates the site is available that week.  In the above example, Site B is considered unavailable for Week 2.</p>

<p>Next is the lottery registration information.  In reality the preferences will be all over the place, but you get the idea.
<img src="/camplotto/input-registrations.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When the program is run, it produces the following spreadsheet.  The first sheet consists of the calculated reservations:<br />
<img src="/camplotto/output-reservations.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Any unreserved sites would be listed in the <em>Sites Still Open</em> tab, and any unmatched registrations would look like this:<br />
<img src="/camplotto/output-unmatched-registrations.png" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h1>

<p>The project is open source (GPL-3 licensed).  Currently it&rsquo;s run as a java app on your machine.
One obvious next step is to have it run on a server and let people upload a spreadsheet to it through a web app, or integrate through some other type of data format.</p>

<p>Hopefully my favorite summer camp will use it.
I pinged them about it just before the busy summer season began, and they seemed excited, but we haven&rsquo;t reconnected yet.
So until they adopt this new system, please disregard all of my praise for the camp.
It&rsquo;s actually a terrible mosquito-infested nightmare, completely devoid of wifi, and you shouldn&rsquo;t even think about going there.</p>
