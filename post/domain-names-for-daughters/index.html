                    <p>Though the biggest domain name purchases are probably long-gone since the initial dot-com boom, they still remain a valued property. They&rsquo;ll never be as valuable as real land of course, since we can always create more of them, as opposed to things like lake-front property.</p>

<p>The recent mad rush for facebook profile names reminded me of this new global scale of gold rush activity. And yes, I&rsquo;m a little annoyed that someone that has been farming this interweb as long as I have was offered a name like dan.tanner2 (in my day, we used Mosiac. And we liked it!). It also reminded me of something I&rsquo;m hoping will come in handy for my two daughters some day - their very own short and memorable domain names.</p>

<p>Finding a decent available domain name is a tenaciously difficult PITA. It&rsquo;s an exercise in creativity and luck, and girls names are especially tough. Not only do you have to wrestle with the general lack of availability, but also the likelihood that they&rsquo;ll change their name when they get married. In my case, that&rsquo;s sometime after age 28, when they&rsquo;ve agreed to start dating.</p>

<p>In my case, my girls are named Maria Mae and Daniela Teresa. All good variants of maria and daniela were taken, which would&rsquo;ve been ideal. And no last names were considered because of the potential marriage name change. After tinkering around for a while, here&rsquo;s what I ended up saving for them:
mariamae.com and danielat.com
They&rsquo;re both fairly mnemonic, and they&rsquo;re both flexible enough to last. And they&rsquo;re both shorter than my domain name!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be a few years, but hopefully they&rsquo;ll be useful. Not to mention give me a little boost in the cool dad category. Not that I&rsquo;ll need any help in that category.</p>

<p>Now&hellip;where did my favorite plaid pants go?</p>
