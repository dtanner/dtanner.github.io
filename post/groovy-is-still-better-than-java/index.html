<p>The idea for this post started last week when a gifted teammate, whose experience lies outside JVM languages, asked me if it was still worth it to write Groovy over Java.  Good question&hellip;</p>

<p>For the last five years, when it comes to writing for the JVM, it&rsquo;s been mostly Groovy for me.<br />
Crap, it&rsquo;s been almost ten years.  <em>dan feels his bones creaking&hellip;</em></p>

<p>When I first saw Venkat Subramaniam gliding through his beautiful java to groovy idioms at a conference, I was impressed.</p>

<p>Little things were nice, like being able to use <code>println 'hello'</code> instead of <code>System.out.println(&quot;hello&quot;);</code>.</p>

<p>Even better was reading a file line by line.  It went from this:</p>

<pre><code>BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;file.txt&quot;));
try {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    String line = br.readLine();

    while (line != null) {
        sb.append(line);
        sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
        line = br.readLine();
        System.out.println(&quot;line = &quot; + line);
    }
} finally {
    if (br != null) {
        br.close();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>new File(&quot;file.txt&quot;).eachLine { println &quot;line = $it&quot; }
</code></pre>

<p><em>Look Ma, a one-liner!</em> That got me hooked.</p>

<p>The <strong>biggest</strong> thing though, which I&rsquo;ve grown to appreciate even more over the years, is the <a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/util/Collection.html">Collection</a> interface. The intrinsic power it gives to collection-like objects is immense.  And hey, c&rsquo;mon over here <a href="http://groovy-lang.org/groovy-dev-kit.html#_iterating_on_maps">Map</a> - you&rsquo;re iterable too as far as we&rsquo;re concerned.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s basic stuff like <code>10.times { println it }</code>, and
<code>someCollection.each { println it }</code>, which shaves a few lines of code from the existing java iteration techniques.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s commonly useful but more powerful improvements like <code>collect()</code>, where you iterate through a collection of things, creating a new collection based on a function. e.g. going from this pre-Java 8 code:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; input = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
List results = new ArrayList();
for (Iterator&lt;Integer&gt; iterator = input.iterator(); iterator.hasNext(); ) {
    Integer integer = iterator.next();
    results.add(integer * 2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>List results = [1, 2, 3].collect { it * 2 }
</code></pre>

<p>Filtering a collection is a similar improvement, where you start with a collection and filter it down based on a condition applied to each element.  e.g. going from (once again, pre-Java 8):</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; input = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
List evenNumbers = new ArrayList();
for (Iterator&lt;Integer&gt; iterator = input.iterator(); iterator.hasNext(); ) {
    Integer integer = iterator.next();
    if (integer % 2 == 0) {
       evenNumbers.add(integer);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>List evenNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4].findAll { it % 2 == 0 }
</code></pre>

<p>It gets even more concise and powerful with methods like <code>collectMany</code> and <code>inject</code>.  They&rsquo;re slightly more complicated, but worth the couple minutes of time it takes to understand.  If I were to give one piece of advice to people new to Groovy, it would be to thoroughly explore that interface.</p>

<p>Lispers may smugly remark, &ldquo;oh, how cute; you&rsquo;re learning functional programming&rdquo;.  And they&rsquo;re right!
The pragmatic functional features of Groovy provide a gentle transition from object-oriented to more pure functional programming for many developers.</p>

<p>Fast-forward a bunch of years, and things have changed. Even though Java hasn&rsquo;t been progressing as fast as many would like, they&rsquo;ve made some significant changes to include features introduced by Groovy, and pioneered by other languages; most notably lambdas and streaming.  For example, the above Java examples can now be written like this:</p>

<pre><code>// read each line in a file
try (Stream&lt;String&gt; stream = Files.lines(Paths.get(&quot;file.txt&quot;))) {
    stream.forEach(System.out::println);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

// collect
List&lt;Integer&gt; results = Stream.of(1, 2, 3).map(v -&gt; v * 2).collect(Collectors.toList());  

// filter
List&lt;Integer&gt; evenNumbers = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4).filter(v -&gt; v % 2 == 0).collect(Collectors.toList());
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip;<strong>much</strong> improved over the old Java syntax. Still not as concise or elegant as Groovy, but fairly close.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-the-original-question">Back to the original question&hellip;</h3>

<p>Is it still worth it to write groovy? Fortunately, I had a chance to make a direct comparison that same week.</p>

<p>It started with a little bake-off we&rsquo;re doing to compare a couple different application design techniques.  I wrote a small service in plain groovy, and my teammate wrote one in java.  Our apps are running in a container that will have their environment-specific overrides specified as environment variables.  I strongly prefer typed configuration objects in the code, rather than things like generic Maps or JSON objects.  Ten minutes of googling, and I couldn&rsquo;t find a utility to let me override typed configuration object values with environment variables.  So I created this project in groovy: <a href="https://github.com/dtanner/env-config-loader-groovy">https://github.com/dtanner/env-config-loader-groovy</a></p>

<p>My teammate initially used the <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config">typesafe/config</a> project to do his configuration overrides.  But its environment overrides are a little verbose IMO, we didn&rsquo;t need its additional complexity, and solving the same problem with different tools adds to the maintenance costs for the team.
So I created a pure java version of the env-config-loader tool as well: <a href="https://github.com/dtanner/env-override">https://github.com/dtanner/env-override</a></p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t excited about writing the java version, but:</p>

<ul>
<li>A pure java implementation can be used by other JVM languages</li>
<li>It seemed like a useful tool for the community</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d be able to have a current and relevant opinion on Groovy&rsquo;s usefulness compared to Java<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>An example line in the Groovy code is this:</p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;String, String&gt; envOverridesMap = getenv().findAll { it.key.startsWith(environmentPrefix) }
</code></pre>

<p>The above line populates a Map from all system environment variables that match a given environment prefix.  I wanted to avoid dependencies if possible to limit the transitive dependencies needed by consumers of the library; the only compile dependency is logback-classic.</p>

<p>On the java side, I also tried building the tool without any dependencies, but it got ugly pretty fast.  Replicating the above Groovy wasn&rsquo;t too bad; you&rsquo;ve basically seen what it looks like in the earlier collect example:</p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;String, String&gt; envOverridesMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
for (String envKey : envVars.keySet()) {
    if (envKey.startsWith(environmentPrefix)) {
        envOverridesMap.put(envKey, envVars.get(envKey));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a more concise way?  IntelliJ suggested this alternative syntax:</p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;String, String&gt; envOverridesMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
envVars.keySet().stream().filter(envKey -&gt; 
    envKey.startsWith(environmentPrefix)).forEach(envKey -&gt; 
        envOverridesMap.put(envKey, envVars.get(envKey)));
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip;but that just made me sad.  I enjoy the new streaming capabilities, but it didn&rsquo;t add value in for me in this case.  It could&rsquo;ve been much cleaner if Map were iterable in java, but it&rsquo;s not and probably won&rsquo;t ever be.</p>

<p>Things got ugly when I tried cloning an arbitrary object, and also dynamically setting properties on an object.  In Java <code>clone()</code> is a protected method, so you can&rsquo;t call it unless you extend from that object.  I tried to hack something together like this:</p>

<pre><code>private static &lt;T&gt; T cloneObject(T obj) {
    try {
        T clone = (T) obj.getClass().newInstance();
        for (Field field : obj.getClass().getDeclaredFields()) {
            if (Modifier.isFinal(field.getModifiers())) {
                continue;
            }
            field.setAccessible(true);
            field.set(clone, field.get(obj));
        }
        return clone;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>but there were exceptional cases I hadn&rsquo;t handled yet, so eventually gave up and added the commons BeanUtils library so I could use the <code>cloneBean()</code> method.  Even uglier was going down the path of dynamic property value overrides.  I had started to toy with this monstrosity:</p>

<pre><code>private static boolean setProperty(Object object, String fieldName, String fieldValueString) {
    Class&lt;?&gt; clazz = object.getClass();
    try {
        Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName);
        field.setAccessible(true);
        Class fieldType = field.getType();
            if (fieldType.equals(Integer.class) || fieldType.equals(Integer.TYPE)) {
                field.setInt(object, Integer.parseInt(fieldValueString));
            } else if (fieldType.equals(Long.class) || fieldType.equals(Long.TYPE)) {
                field.setLong(object, Long.parseLong(fieldValueString));
            } else if (fieldType.equals(Boolean.class) || fieldType.equals(Boolean.TYPE)) {
                field.setBoolean(object, Boolean.parseBoolean(fieldValueString));
            } else if (fieldType.equals(Long.class) || fieldType.equals(Long.TYPE)) {
                field.set(object, Long.parseLong(fieldValueString));
            } else {
                Class.forName(field.getDeclaringClass().getName());
                field.getDeclaringClass().getConstructor(String.class).newInstance(fieldValueString);
                field.set(object, field.getType().getConstructor(String.class).newInstance(fieldValueString));
            }
        return true;
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException e) {
        log.warn(&quot;Environment override for property &quot; + fieldName + &quot; found, but no matching property exists.&quot;);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip;before punting.  Since I had already accepted the BeanUtils dependency, I was able to use the <code>copyProperty</code> method and delete a lot of potentially brittle code.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>You probably enjoyed reading the java code as much as I enjoyed writing it.  It&rsquo;s not the semicolons or the verbose exception handling.  It was that I could do in a single line of Groovy what took an entire method in the equivalent Java.  This is a big deal in terms of productivity, maintenance, and code quality.</p>

<p>There are other advantages to using Groovy, for example listed by Peter Ledbrook <a href="http://blog.cacoethes.co.uk/groovyandgrails/groovy-in-light-of-java-8">here</a>.
As to the question of when it&rsquo;s appropriate to write Java over Groovy, there&rsquo;s really only a couple reasons in my opinion:</p>

<p>The first is the reason I just insulted the java code I wrote, but still intend to promote and deprecate the groovy version; it&rsquo;s a library that can be run on any JVM language.  The Groovy library is limited to Groovy usage.  It&rsquo;s worth it for that situation.</p>

<p>The second is if you&rsquo;re using a framework or library that doesn&rsquo;t let you easily use Groovy.  If you&rsquo;re going down this path, I think you&rsquo;ll know it when you see it.  e.g. If you want to write a lot of RxJava, you might want to stick with Java, at least for now.</p>

<p>tl;dr; I still think Groovy is still generally a better Java.</p>
