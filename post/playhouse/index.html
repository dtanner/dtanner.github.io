                    <p>A few months ago, I promised Maria that I would get her and Daniela a playhouse for their birthdays.  I was originally going to buy them a little Step2 playhouse, which would&rsquo;ve been totally fine.  But my good friend Rob, a skilled woodworker, convinced me that building a playhouse was the way to go.  I was a little tentative about the idea, since I hadn&rsquo;t built a real structure before on my own, but he very generously offered to help (and with two kids of his own, meant that his wife Karen also very generously helped&hellip;we still can&rsquo;t thank them enough!)</p>

<p>So I bought this <a href="/playhouse/playhouse-small.pdf">plan</a> (which I can&rsquo;t find any more, so am including it here), made a few modifications, and off we went:</p>

<p>Starting with a pile of boards&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/playhouse/100828_IMG_3919.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>and a friend who know&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s doing&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/playhouse/100829_IMG_3929.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>things started to take shape, and a lot of space!</p>

<p><img src="/playhouse/100829_IMG_3931.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>We passed the initial kid inspection&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/playhouse/100829_IMG_3933.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>and had lots of &ldquo;help&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="/playhouse/100829_IMG_3937.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first wall goes up&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/playhouse/100904_IMG_1129.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>And the playhouse is now fully operational.</p>

<p><img src="/playhouse/100918_IMG_1257.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>But we realized that it absolutely has to be red.</p>

<p><img src="/playhouse/100918_IMG_3944.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Much better color!</p>

<p><img src="/playhouse/100919_IMG_1305.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>I finished up the railing in the dark with a million mosquito friends.</p>

<p><img src="/playhouse/100920_IMG_1307.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>One of the owner-operators.</p>

<p><img src="/playhouse/100929_DSC_4771.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Of course it needs a doorbell.</p>

<p><img src="/playhouse/101003_IMG_1369.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>and a solar-powered light for late night parties.</p>

<p><img src="/playhouse/101016_DSC_4783.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>With the trim, it&rsquo;s pretty much done!</p>
